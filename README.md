# Disclaimer

Okay, look. I made this after using Swift on-and-off for a few days. If you seriously think this is the best code I will ever write in my entire career, you are nuts. So, yeah, if I'm applying for a job and you want to do some sort of ridiculous "code review" interview segment and you want me to talk about **this code**, I am going to walk right out of there.

# Purpose

This animates insertions into an AVL tree.
